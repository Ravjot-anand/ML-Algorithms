Bias (Error from Simplicity):

Bias is the error caused when a model is too simple to capture the true pattern.
It cant perform well on training data and thus result on high error on test data.


Characteristics:
Strong assumptions
Misses important patterns
High training error
High test error

Example:
Linear regression on curved data
Low-degree polynomial for complex data
📌 This is called UNDERFITTING


Variance (Error from Sensitivity)

Variance is the error caused when a model is too complex and reacts too much to training data.
Works good on training data But cant perform on test data

Characteristics:
Fits noise in data
Very low training error
High test error

Example:
High-degree polynomial
Decision tree with no depth limit
📌 This is called OVERFITTING

********Bias misses the trend, variance memorizes the noise.*******
