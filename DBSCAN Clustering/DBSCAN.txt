DBSCAN Clustering:
It is density based clustering. Their is another algo called OPTICS work on this principle

DBSCAN doesn't need you to tell it "K" (Number of Clusters). It figures that out itself. But it needs two other rules:
1)Epsilon: The "Reach."
*How far can you reach to touch the next point?
*If $\epsilon$ is too small, nobody touches anyone (everyone is Noise).
*If $\epsilon$ is too big, everyone touches everyone (1 giant cluster).

2)MinPoints: The "Crowd Size."
*How many people need to be together to officially call it a "Group"?
*Usually set to 3 or 4.

The Three Types of Points
DBSCAN labels every single data point as one of these:

Core Point: The "Popular Kid."
Has at least MinPoints neighbors within Epsilon distance.
These points are fully inside a dense cluster.

Border Point: The "Sidekick."
Does NOT have enough neighbors to be a Core Point, BUT is close enough to touch a Core Point.
It gets included in the cluster, but it's on the edge.

Noise Point: The "Loner."
Neither a Core Point nor close to one.
DBSCAN completely ignores these. This is its superpower. It cleans your data for you.

*this three types of points are represented in png attached*

Algorithm:

Step 1: identify all point as either core, border ornoise point

Step 2: for all of unclustered core points
 Step 1a: Create a new cluster
 Step 2a: add all points that are unclustered and density connected(within epsilon distance) to current point 
         into the cluster

Step 3: For each unclustered border point assign it to cluster of nearest core point

Step 4: Leave all the noise point as it is
